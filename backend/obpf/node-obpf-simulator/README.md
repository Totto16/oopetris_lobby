# Obpf Simulator Node.js Wrapper

## What is this?

This wraps [obpf/simulator](https://github.com/OpenBrickProtocolFoundation/simulator) functionality for Node.js

## Platform support

We officially support ONLY Linux, since this is only meant to be run on a server!

## How to use

You NEVER should need this individually, but this is part of [OOPetris Lobby](https://github.com/Totto16/oopetris_lobby). If you need to run that lobby, use the provided dockerfile / Docker image, where this is already build correctly.

## How to build it yourself

This uses node-gyp to build the wrapper, you need certain things locally in your `PATH` / `LIB_DIR`. If you really want to develop this, please ask on the discord for help. To explain it here, would not be feasible, as this isn't meant to change very often and doesn't need active development.
